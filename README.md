This project is divided into 4 parts.

The second file is updated with a feature to query the vol surface. In the GUI the user can input strike and maturity to get the IV from the interpolated surface.

The third file is an analysis of some vol surfaces using market option chains in different time periods.

The fouth file contains some SV models as well as their graphical representation using a MC simulation.
